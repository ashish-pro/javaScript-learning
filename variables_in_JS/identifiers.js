// Identifiers: All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.


/*Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

 1. The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

 2. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

 3. Names must begin with a letter.

 4. Names can also begin with $ and _ .

 5. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).

 6. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

//JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
